# Gridgame

Gridgame is a simple game, almost like the inverse of Tetris.

The goal is to connect three or more of the same color to remove those tiles. If any tile touches the top, the game is over.

## Instructions

Tap or click on the column you want to add the next tile, you see which color it has in the preview section in the top.

## Play it

You can play it online at https://online-gamehub.com/games/gridgame, you have to register an account first and buy it with virtual currency though.
