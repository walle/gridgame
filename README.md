# Gridgame

Gridgame is a simple game, almost like the inverse of Tetris.

The goal is to connect three or more of the same color to remove those tiles. If any tile touches the top, the game is over.

## Instructions

Tap or click on the column you want to add the next tile, you see which color it has in the preview section in the top.

## Play it

You can play it online at https://online-gamehub.com/games/gridgame, you have to register an account first and buy it with virtual currency though.

## Building from source

You can play the development version by just opening index.html in your web browser. If you want to build it and run the release version you have to install `nodejs` and `uglifyjs`. `npm install uglify-js -g`.
To build the game, just run rake in the main directory. The game will open in your default web browser.
